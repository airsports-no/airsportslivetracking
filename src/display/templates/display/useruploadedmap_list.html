    this purpose we support the mbtiles format that can be exported from a wide the variety of applications. If this seems
    intimidating, the already included OSM and OpenCycle maps provide global coverage and are in many places perfect
    for navigation.
    <h4>For the intermediate user</h4>
    <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiles Desktop</a> comes in both free and paid versions and
    supports easy georeferencing and exporting of existing maps in the mbtiles format.
    <h4>For the power user</h4>
    <p>
        For full map control the popular QGis GIS application supports export in the <a

        Air Sport Live Tracking provides no support for the third-party applications used for generating the mbtiles
        files.
