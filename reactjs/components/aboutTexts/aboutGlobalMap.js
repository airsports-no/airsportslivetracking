    <h2>Global map</h2>
    <p>
        The global map shows an overview of ongoing and upcoming events, as well as all traffic currently using the
        tracking platform. By clicking on individual events the user can jump to the event details on the map and also
        to the competition tracking pages if they exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        The map is for entertainment use only, but we strive to keep the positions up-to-date for all the users who are
        actively tracking their aircraft position.
